Andy, 8, has a dream - he wants to produce his very
own dictionary. This is not an easy task for him, as
the number of words that he knows is, well, not quite
enough. Instead of thinking up all the words himself,
he has a briliant idea. From his bookshelf he would
pick one of his favourite story books, from which he
would copy out all the distinct words. By arranging
the words in alphabetical order, he is done! Of course,
it is a really time-consuming job, and this is where a
computer program is helpful
